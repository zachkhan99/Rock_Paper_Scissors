Goal:   Create a rock, paper, scissors program where the user plays against the computer


Input:  User will be asked to input "rock", "papers", or "scissors" to continue to play the game
        User can input "q" if they want to quit the game

Output: The program will display a prompt to the user, asking them to type "rock", "papers", "scissors", or "q"
        Display the round number
        Display the user's choice
        Display the computer's choice
        Display the result of the round
        Display the user's score and the computer's score
        If the user quits the game, display a good bye message and the overall score
        If the user inputs anything other than "rock", "papers", "scissors", or "q", display error message and to try again.

Steps:  1. Include necessary header files
            - cstdlib for rand functions
            - ctime for time function

        2. Intialize variables
            - "userScore" to store the user's score (starting at 0)
            - "computerScore" to store the computer's score (starting at 0)
            - "round" to keep track of the current round (starts at 0)
        
        3. Make an array called "options" that includes the choices for the game

        4. Seed the random number generator based on time

        5. Make a loop for the game so the game can keep going after every turn

        6. While in the loop
            - Increment the round by 1
            - Display the round number and the game to the user
            - Ask the user to input "rock", "papers", "scissors", or "q"
            - Read the user's input
        
        7. If the user wants to quit the game, break out of the loop and end the game
            - Display good bye message and the final score of the game.
        
        8. Generate a random choice from the computer 
            - Choice is from 0 to 2
            - This will be the index of the array called "options"
        
        9. Display the user's choice and the computer's choice

        10. Determine who wins the round
            - If the user's choice is the same as the computer's choice, it's a draw
            - If the user beats the computer, increment user's score by 1
            - If the computer beats the user, increment computer's score by 1
            - Display the Result of the round to the user
            - If "rock", "papers", "scissors", or "q" was not typed in, display error message and tell the user to try again
        
        11. After every round, display the user's score and the computer's score.
